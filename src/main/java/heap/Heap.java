     *   The tree is complete:

     *        is smaller than `c[i]`'s priority

     *     3. The tree cannot contain duplicate *values*; note that dupliate
     *        *priorities* are still allowed.
     *     4. map contains one entry for each element of the heap, so
     *        map.size() == c.size()
     *     5. For each value v in the heap, its map entry contains in the
     *        the index of v in c. Thus: map.get(b[i]) = i.
